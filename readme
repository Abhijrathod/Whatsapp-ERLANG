# WhatsApp Clone in Erlang

This project is a simplified version of a messaging application inspired by WhatsApp, implemented in Erlang. It demonstrates the use of processes for handling users and messages, showcasing the scalability and reliability of Erlang in building concurrent applications.

## Features
